<h1>What I Do</h1>

<p>I know I may still be in high school but I already know what I want to do in my life. I want to go march with various Drum and bugle corps. As of right now I march for the Licking Heights Marching Band. I've been in the Marching Band for two years now and I've had a great time. As my career moves forward I want to keep getting better. I can't wait to see how the Licking heights Marching Band evolves over the years. After High School I'll be offering private lessons. If you have any questions about it please contact me.
