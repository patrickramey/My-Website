<h2>What I Do</h2>



<p>I know I may still be in high school but I already know what I want to do in my life. I want to go march with various Drum and bugle corps. As of right now I march for the Licking Heights Marching Band. I've been in the Marching Band for two years now and I've had a great time. As my career moves forward I want to keep getting better. I can't wait to see how the Licking heights Marching Band evolves over the years.
